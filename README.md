# Kubernetes Ingress Controller for AWS

This is an ingress controller for [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) — the open-source container deployment,
scaling, and management system — on AWS. It runs inside a Kubernetes cluster to monitor changes to your ingress
resources and orchestrate [AWS Load Balancers](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) accordingly.

This ingress controller uses the EC2 instance metadata of the worker node where it's currently running to find the
additional details about the cluster provisioned by [Kubernetes on top of AWS](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kubernetes-on-aws).
This information is used to manage AWS resources for each ingress objects of the cluster.

## Features

- Uses CloudFormation to guarantee consistent state
- Automatic discovery of SSL certificates
- Automatic forwarding of requests to all Worker Nodes, even with auto scaling
- Automatic cleanup of unnecessary managed resources
- Can be used in clusters created by [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), see our [deployment guide for Kops](deploy/kops.md)

## Upgrade

### <v0.4.0 to >=v0.4.0

In versions before v.04.0 we used AWS Tags that were set by CloudFormation automatically to find
some AWS resources.
This behavior has been changed to use custom non cloudformation tags.

In order to update to v0.4.0, you have to add the following tags to your AWs Loadbalancer
SecurityGroup before updating:
- `kubernetes:application=kube-ingress-aws-controller`
- `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-id>=owned`

Additionally you must ensure that the instance where the ingress-controller is
running has the clusterID tag `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-id>=owned` set
(was `ClusterID=<cluster-id>` before v0.4.0).

## Development Status

This controller is used in production since Q1 2017. It aims to be out-of-the-box useful for anyone
running Kubernetes. Jump down to the [Quickstart](#trying-it-out) to try it out—and please let us know if you have
trouble getting it running by filing an
[Issue](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller/issues).
If you created your cluster with [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), see our [deployment guide for Kops](deploy/kops.md)

As of this writing, it's being used only in small production use cases at [Zalando](https://tech.zalando.com/), and
is not yet battle-tested. We're actively seeking devs/teams/companies to try it out and share feedback so we can
make improvements.

We are also eager to bring new contributors on board. See [our contributor guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
to get started, or [claim a "Help Wanted" item](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

## Why We Created This Ingress Controller

The maintainers of this project are building an infrastructure that runs [Kubernetes on top of AWS](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kubernetes-on-aws) at large scale (for nearly 200 delivery teams), and with automation. As such, we're creating our own tooling to support this new infrastructure. We couldn't find an existing ingress controller that operates like this one does, so we created one ourselves.

We're using this ingress controller with [Skipper](http://github.com/zalando/skipper), an HTTP router that Zalando
has used in production since Q4 2015 as part of its front-end microservices architecture. Skipper's also open
source and has some outstanding features, that we
[documented here](https://zalando.github.io/skipper/dataclients/kubernetes/). Feel
free to use it, or use another ingress of your choosing.


## How It Works

This controller continuously polls the API server to check for ingress resources. It runs an infinite loop. For
each cycle it creates load balancers for new ingress resources, and deletes the load balancers for obsolete/removed
ingress resources.

This is achieved using AWS CloudFormation. For more details check our [CloudFormation Documentation](cloudformation.md)

The controller *will not* manage the security groups required to allow access from the Internet to the load balancers.
It assumes that their lifecycle is external to the controller itself.

### Discovery

On startup, the controller discovers the AWS resources required for the controller operations:

1. The AutoScalingGroup

    Simple lookup of the Auto Scaling Group that name matches the `aws:autoscaling:groupName` tag from the
    EC2 instance running the controller.

2. The Security Group

    Lookup of the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-id>` tag of the Security Group matching the clusterID for the controller node and `kubernetes:application` matching the value `kube-ingress-aws-controller` or as fallback for <v0.4.0
    tag `aws:cloudformation:logical-id` matching the value `IngressLoadBalancerSecurityGroup` (only clusters created by CF).

### Creating Load Balancers

When the controller learns about new ingress resources, it uses the host specified in it to automatically determine
the most specific, valid certificate to use. The certificate has to be valid for at least 7 days. An example ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-app
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test-app.example.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: test-app-service
          servicePort: main-port
```

The Application Load Balancer created by the controller will have both an HTTP listener and an HTTPS listener. The
latter will use the automatically selected certificate.

Alternatively, you can specify a domain used for automatically selecting a
certificate with an annotation like the one shown below. This is useful if you
have multiple hosts rules defined and want to make sure to select a certificate
for the right hostname.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
  annotations:
    zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert-domain: alt.name.org
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test-app.example.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: test-app-service
          servicePort: main-port
  - host: alt.name.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: test-app-service
          servicePort: main-port
```

As a third option you can specify the [Amazon Resource Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) (ARN)
of the desired certificate with an annotation like the one shown here:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
  annotations:
    zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123456789012:certificate/f4bd7ed6-bf23-11e6-8db1-ef7ba1500c61
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test-app.example.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: test-app-service
          servicePort: main-port
```

You can select the [Application Load Balancer Scheme](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html#load-balancer-scheme)
with an annotation like the one shown here:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myingress
  annotations:
    zalando.org/aws-load-balancer-scheme: internal
spec:
  rules:
  - host: test-app.example.org
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: test-app-service
          servicePort: main-port
```

You can only select from `internet-facing` (default) and `internal` options.

The new Application Load Balancers have a custom tag marking them as *managed* load balancers to differentiate them
from other load balancers. The tag looks like this:

    `kubernetes:application` = `kube-ingress-aws-controller`

They also share the `kubernetes.io/cluster/<cluster-id>` tag with other resources from the cluster where it belongs.

### Deleting load balancers

When the controller detects that a managed load balancer for the current cluster doesn't have a matching ingress
resource anymore, it deletes all the previously created resources.

## Building

This project provides a [`Makefile`](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller/blob/master/Makefile)
that you can use to build either a binary or a Docker image. You have
to have [glide installed](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) and do
`glide install`, before building.

### Building a Binary

To build a binary for the Linux operating system, simply run `make` or `make build.linux`.

### Building a Docker Image

To create a Docker image instead, execute `make build.docker`. You can then push your Docker image to the Docker
registry of your choice.

## Deploy

To [deploy](deploy/README.md) the ingress controller, use the
[example YAML](deploy/ingress-controller.yaml) as the descriptor.
You can customize the image used in the example YAML file.

We provide `registry.opensource.zalan.do/teapot/kube-ingress-aws-controller:latest` as a publicly usable Docker image
built from this codebase. You can deploy it with 2 easy steps:
- Replace the placeholder for your region inside the example YAML, for ex., `eu-west-1`
- Use kubectl to execute the command  `kubectl apply -f deploy/ingress-controller.yaml`

If you use [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) to create your
cluster, please use our [deployment guide for Kops](deploy/kops.md)

## Trying it out

The Ingress Controller's responsibility is limited to managing load balancers, as described above. To have a fully
functional setup, additionally to the ingress controller, you can use [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper)
to route the traffic to the application. The setup follows what's
described [here](https://kubernetes-on-aws.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/ingress.html).

You can deploy `skipper` as a `DaemonSet` using [another example YAML](deploy/skipper.yaml) by executing the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/skipper.yaml
```

To complete the setup, you'll need to fulfill some additional requirements regarding security groups and IAM
roles; [more info here](deploy/requirements.md).

### DNS

To have convenient DNS names for your application, you can use the
Kubernetes-Incubator project, [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns).
It's not strictly necessary for this Ingress Controller to work,
though.
